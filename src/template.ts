{{/each}}
{{#each colleagueProfile.preferences}}
  {{#unless this}}{{@key}} thinking weak.{{/unless}}
{{/each}}

{{colleagueProfile.traits.assertiveness}} Assertiveness ({{#if (eq colleagueProfile.traits.assertiveness "first-third")}}low{{else if (eq colleagueProfile.traits.assertiveness "second-third")}}medium{{else if (eq colleagueProfile.traits.assertiveness "third-third")}}high{{else}}N/A{{/if}})
